# Introduction

A basic notetaking application with a list view, a entry view and apple intelligence based autotagging features have been implemented and integrated into the application code in `magicnote/`. The app can be run using xcode on a iphone simulator.

# Task

Read through the code implemented in magicnote/ directory and understand the code in depth. Make notes like a junior developer would need to understand the implemenation. Create a `docs/` directory and add one or more .md files to document these notes. Keep in mind that this would become an on-going documentation and would be updated after every new feature implementation.

Get started, good luck!
