# Intro

We have an inclination to make this note taking software "block" based. A block is an unit of text and it has its own use case. For example, a simple "paragraph" block is a simple text with single font and fontSize value, but a "sketch" block would use the text as a description of a particular sketch the user wants to render and will generate a picture based on the text, such a block might have additional props like sketchType, blockBgColor, etc. 

A set of blocks along with a layout makes a template. For example, a "screenwriting" template could use a "camera" block which talks about camera positions, or "props" block which talk about props in set for a movie and then "dialogue" blocks etc. A collection of blocks are preloaded on to a template, while the user can load any other blocks to make or extend into a custom template.

# Task

Brainstorm ideas for blocks and create a document for different templates we could create using this software bringing value widely across domains to various beings who use text in their work.
