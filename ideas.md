Can we make the storage block based?

Everytime we have 2 newlines, we have a block. A paragraph, a picture, audio?, video?, this could lead to templates, say an author could use a particular template made with a particular set of blocks. Some templates could be screenwriting, journaling. Blocks could have a marketplace in future? long press return to create a new block and show blocks options? say people could easily choose make a sketch based on my description
